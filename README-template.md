# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).  

This is my first attempt at following pre-designed projects for the purposes of learning HTML and CSS. Like all things, it's a work in progress.
